Blueprint
x- Add power transmission
x- Add roboports
- Address inserter-bottlenecked assemblers
x- Route the raw-material combinators through the master switch
ip- Add a master switch for rocket requests as well
- Fix output inserters for the recipes produced in machines other than Assembler Mk3s
- Add shufflers to the left wing
- Fix input inserters for the Stack Inserter and Filter Inserter machines
- Toggle the main input switch to off by default
x- There's a machine missing a recipe next to the green wire and red wire -> PDC would fit with a cheeky 4-belt setup if I can't find the actual recipe
   - Pretty sure this is MDI ammo - PDC already has a cheeky setup
x- Not all lamps are wired up on green
- Fix inserter circuits for any hand-placed inserters
  - heavy bearing
  - heavy composite
  - heavy assembly
  - ...
- Add output inserters for machines on the left wing
x- Remove the inline infinity drain
x- Set drain combinator to off by default
x- Add facility producing Lifesupport Equipment (Mk1) + combinators for it
- Update quotas for the inserter warehouse chains
  - Reduce buffer buildup (total size as well as unused ingredients
  - Some ingredients are missing, e.g. accumulatros and solar panels
- Some inserters seem to be unwired - a full fill + drain resulted in 13 leftover items (should have check to see what they were!)
- Some hand-placed input inserters (mostly for non-assembler facilities) aren't wired or set properly
  x- medpack 1 & 2



Script
- Assign combinators from left to right first then top to bottom
- Add quotas for additional items (nixie tubes, space rails, etc) -> ensure each assembler's products have combinators
- Turn all the signal-Y combinators on

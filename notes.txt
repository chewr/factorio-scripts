Blueprint
- Address inserter-bottlenecked assemblers
  - Script might be able to indicate which these are
  - Draft 2 will demonstrate empirically

Fix inserter circuits for any hand-placed inserters
  x- heavy bearing
  x- heavy composite
  x- heavy assembly
  - ...
- Some inserters seem to be unwired - a full fill + drain resulted in 13 leftover items (should have check to see what they were!)

Script
- Assign combinators from left to right first then top to bottom
- Add verification step that flags any recipes whose products do not have combinators
- Turn all the signal-Y combinators on

Finalization
- Toggle the main input switch to off by default
- Set drain combinator to off by default
- Test rocket circuitry
